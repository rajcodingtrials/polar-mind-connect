              <p> In recent years, developmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and speech delays have become increasingly prevalent 
                    among children worldwide. More families are facing the challenges of early diagnosis and long-term support, as conditions like autism 
                    often require continuous, specialized intervention. This rising incidence underscores the urgent need for scalable mental health and 
                    developmental support services tailored specifically to these growing concerns.

              <p>
                However, accessing timely and effective treatment remains a significant hurdle for many families. Long waitlists for specialists, 
      high costs of therapy sessions, and a general shortage of trained professionals make it difficult for children with special needs to 
      get the care they require when they need it most. These delays not only affect a childâ€™s developmental progress but also place immense 
      emotional and financial stress on parents and caregivers who are desperate for support.
