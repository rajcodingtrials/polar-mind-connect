2. Toggle it ON before starting your session
3. The system will automatically adjust its expectations and feedback

### What Changes in Speech Delay Mode?
- **Lower Accuracy Threshold**: Accepts approximations of correct sounds
- **Supportive Feedback**: Focuses on effort rather than perfection
- **Sound-Specific Guidance**: Provides tips for making specific sounds
- **Encouraging Tone**: More supportive and less corrective language

## Microphone Settings

If your child's voice is quiet or the microphone isn't picking up speech clearly:

1. **Enable Amplification**: Toggle the microphone boost feature
2. **Adjust Gain**: Increase the sensitivity level if needed
